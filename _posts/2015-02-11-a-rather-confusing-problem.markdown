# Preface
One of my hobbies is teaching C to second graders (part time). You might be surprised, but the current state of things in my university is that they start programming courses with C# and some kind of simplified assembler for an imaginary computer (of course, they have an emulator). In parallel they are learning Java (so you might imagine the mess in their heads!).

So here is one of the tasks I am asking them in order to break their thinking patterns, which I find quite beneficial.

## Task
Insert a bit of code before 'if' statement to make it compile and output "Hello". Only C89 is allowed, no defines.
{% highlight c linenos %}

if (ArrayList<Int> *ptr != NULL)
   puts("Hello!");

{% endhighlight %}

The success is provided by thinking a bit outside of the box and by not trusting your eyes and reflexes.
